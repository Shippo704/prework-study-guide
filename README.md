# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was an introduction to using the command terminal, VS Code, and GitHub. The webpage was created as an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JS. As a result, I solidified my existing base knowledge of bash, HTML, and CSS. I was also able to relate JS to my base knowledge of Java. Additionally, I learned how to use Git and GitHub at their simplest level as it relates to this program.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used as a reference in the future. The cards with notes about the topics covered in the prework are a quick reference for a few useful things to know about each topic. The files created in the prework (index.html, style.css, script.js) can be used as a more in-depth reference to examine syntax and to help determine where small errors might occur.

Using Ctrl+Shift+I will open the DevTools console which can be used for debugging the JS code.
